üîê How IMPACT Application Works with SSO
1. SSO Integration Overview
Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to re-enter credentials. For the IMPACT application, SSO integration is typically done using identity providers (IdPs) like:

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Okta

Ping Identity

ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)

2. Authentication Flow with SSO
Here‚Äôs a typical SSO authentication flow:

User tries to access the IMPACT application.

IMPACT redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication.

User logs in using corporate credentials (e.g., company email and password).

IdP validates credentials and sends back a token (SAML or OIDC-based) to IMPACT.

IMPACT uses this token to authenticate the user and allows access to the application.

üîê Role of Security Groups in SSO Configuration
Security groups are essential for access control and are often attached/configured in the IdP to manage which users can access the IMPACT application and what level of access they get.

1. Group-Based Access Control
Users in your organization are assigned to security groups like:

IMPACT_Users

IMPACT_Admins

IMPACT_ReadOnly

These groups are managed in the IdP (e.g., Azure AD).

2. Mapping Groups to Roles
During the SSO login process, the user's group membership is passed to the IMPACT application in the authentication token.

IMPACT uses this information to map users to application roles:

Admins can create/modify users.

Users may only have view/edit permissions.

ReadOnly group may have restricted access.

3. Provisioning & Authorization
The business or IT team manages group membership.

Only users added to the approved security groups can access the IMPACT application via SSO.

This improves security, auditability, and simplifies user onboarding/offboarding.

‚úÖ Example Setup (Using Azure AD)
Component	Description
IdP	Azure Active Directory
SSO Protocol	SAML 2.0 or OIDC
Security Groups	IMPACT_Admin, IMPACT_User, IMPACT_ReadOnly
Group-to-Role Mapping	Done in application settings or token claims
Access Control	Based on group membership
Provisioning	Done by Super Users/Admins via group assignment

Summary
SSO provides a secure and seamless login experience.

Security groups are attached/configured in the IdP to control who has access and what permissions they have in the IMPACT application.

This approach ensures centralized access control, easy user management, and improved security compliance.
